<!--This is the example of property bind which can bind string/boolean or any other type without any restriction-->
<input [id] = "propBind" type = "text" value="Manish">

<!--This is interpolation binding. Hence, it has a restriction that it can only bind the string attributes
In the below example the disabled property is binded normally and the second id is binded using interpolation-->
<input bind-disabled = "interBind" id = {{interBindStr}} type="text" value="Kumar">
